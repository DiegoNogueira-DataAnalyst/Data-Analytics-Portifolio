# Diego Nogueira â€” Aspiring Data Analyst with a Business-Driven Mindset

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio!

I'm Diego Nogueira, a career shifter passionate about transforming data into strategic insights.  
Currently transitioning into the data analytics field, I combine a strong background in business operations and decision-making with hands-on learning in tools like:

- SQL  
- Excel  
- Python
- R 
- Tableau  

This repository showcases real-world case studies where I apply data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and storytelling to solve business problems. Each project reflects my commitment to clarity, logic, and impact â€” always with the end user or stakeholder in mind.

ðŸ“Œ What makes my journey unique?

- I approach data with a **problem-solving mindset**, not just technical skills.  
- I practice **analytical thinking**, not just data reporting.  
- I build my projects to reflect **real-world business questions**, always connecting data to action.

I'm open to **remote or hybrid roles**, especially in the **UK/Europe**, and eager to join a team where I can grow while contributing meaningfully.
